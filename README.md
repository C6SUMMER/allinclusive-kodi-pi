All the nice kodi plugins already installed. 

Just put this .kodi in your home account.

PS: most probably there is also some cache in this folder. 
If you know what is to be removed to make it smaller, pls email us.

In order to install it, do:

sudo su -
apt-get install git
exit
git clone https://github.com/aplicatii-romanesti/allinclusive-kodi-pi.git
