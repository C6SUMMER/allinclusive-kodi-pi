00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:34,418

<I> Fire everywhere, Marry? </ I>

6
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,572
<I> Where do you want to start? </ I>

7
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,629
American Ultra.

8
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:26,394
<I> Well, began three days ago in the city ... </ i>

9
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,180
<I> Liman, West Virginia. </ I>

10
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,484
Here I live with my girlfriend Phoebe.

11
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,298
She is the only good thing that happened to me.

12
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:51,484
Honestly I can not remember life before her.

13
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,159
We were a couple, but perfect.

14
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:00,250
She was perfect, I was the bastard.

15
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,231
And we were very happy.

16
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,622
I wanted to be with me, so save for the perfect ring.

17
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,306
And plan the perfect romantic trip to surprise.

18
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,323
And then I fucked too.

19
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:22,703
<I> This is the last call for flight 1204 to Hawaii. </ I>

20
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:28,531
<I> I repeat, this is the last call for flight 1204 to Hawaii. </ I>

21
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,653
Mike demons.

22
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,163
<B> Welcome to Liman. </ B>

23
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,656
I am so sorry.

24
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,729
I thought I could overcome the panic attack this time.

25
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,704
- It's okay. - It is not.

26
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,728
- It's okay. - Not well!

27
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,669
This is something I want to do for you, then I screw ...

28
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,737
and now we're going back home.

29
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,609
- You did not want to. - I did, my fault ...

30
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,582
- You should be mad at me. - Do not!

31
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,908
Why not?

32
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,016
- You can not help it. - Fine thanks.

33
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,685
Oh, hell!

34
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:26,194
- Have you got something up? - Of course not, we were traveling.

35
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:29,593
- What for...? - Insurance?

36
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,601
Yes.

37
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:33,807
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,656
- Hi Phoebe. - Hello.

39
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,810
- Mike. - Hello.

40
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,887
Did not they were going on vacation?

41
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,362
To Hawaii?

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,785
Another You had little episode, Mike?

43
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,307
Phoebe know what ...

44
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,488
I want you to take this boy home ...

45
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,697
for not going to panic on the road ...

46
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:12,100
or leave it in the city.

47
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,579
Is that why we stopped?

48
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,512
Careful how I talk Mrs. Larson.

49
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,675
I'd hate to check the car.

50
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,846
This boy is your boyfriend ...

51
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,651
will begin to brush your teeth every night in the police station.

52
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,653
- Is not it Mike? - This is Sheriff Watts.

53
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,029
Well, I welcome you back to the city.

54
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,745
I pick up the suitcases.

55
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,620
¿Phoebe want to eat?

56
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,543
This could be the right time.

57
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,584
Hey, Mike.

58
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,692
What is this?

59
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,673
Is this okay? I believe-

60
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,858
Phoebe, sorry.

61
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,713
Do you burn your hand?

62
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,528
Do you only let me cook, right?

63
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,846
Yes, I'm sorry.

64
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,197
Stop apologizing.

65
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,742
All right.

How do I read the damn story?

78
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,485
Hello. How are you?

79
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,290
Hello, Lasseter.

80
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:58,090
You're not my assistant, Petey. What are you doing here?

81
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,706
I know, you just missed.

82
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:03,238
Come on, you're no longer at the big table, you can let some things go.

83
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:04,648
Enough, Douglas.

84
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, I'm going, you need something ...

85
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600

<I> Your program activated tough guys ... </ i>

87
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,802
<I> you have to eliminate Howell. </ I>

88

<I> will take care of it in 24 hours. </ I>

90
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,283
This is American soil, they can not do that.

91
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,390
We promised to protect. Who is it?

92
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:43,563
¿Yates?

93
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,148
<I> The operation is in progress. </ I>

<I> - Who is it? - Do not interfere, good afternoon </ i>.

96
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,161
Then Apollo ape and brick Chip say ...

97
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,162
... What the hell do I go?

98
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:58,966
They found that Spice was in charge of resistance.

99
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:01,431
But what they found will know the

100
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,190
next book, the dog is bad asteroid.

101
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,934
- No, man. - I know.

102
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,600
You are a genious.

103
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,927
If you got it is because it is the best friend of man, not the monkey.

104
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,596
Sure, it makes sense to me.

105
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,630
Is dog!

106
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,789
- You should write it. - I do not know, I like to think about it ...

107
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,144
and talk about it.

108
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,845
- The Ape Apollo and his adventures. - I love to tell me about it.

109
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,488
Other people liked it too.

110
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,225
As if they were...

111
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,639
We would love to read it, if you write, really.

112
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,027
You'd be very good at it.

113
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:50,802
- You know what scares me Phoebe? - Than?

114
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:55,881
As that car there, it has moved too.

115
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,376
As it was built in a factory, in a production line ...

116
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:03,304
and then he was shipped here.

117
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,389
And then those guys stolen elsewhere.

118
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,587
Exactly.

119
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,630
But all that time, for years ...

120
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,345
or because I do not know, decades ...

121
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,398
the tree has been in this place as if nothing until tonight ...

122
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:19,273
to stop the car.

123
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,583
Yes?

124
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:24,635
So this car is like to leave.

125
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,506
And that tree is always as-

126
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,518
like stopping. Like he was detained for years ...

127
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:35,587
until tonight when that thing wanted to go and ...

128
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,956
no, you stop too.

129
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,855
The tree has never done anything, it's like ...

130
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:51,349
destroy this beauty .. Very beautiful and fast moving thing.

131
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,340
- And ... - Why are you crying?

132
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,403
Because Phoebe ...

133
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,243
I am a tree.

134
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:02,682
Do not.

135
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,783
Do not.

136
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,322
I think I'm the tree and I think ...

137
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,115
you are the car and I'll stop.

138
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,682
You're not the tree.

139
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:12,682
It's okay.

140
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,561
I love you.

141
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,561
Phoebe. I'm sorry for what the trip.

142
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:32,067
Okay, seriously.

143
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,845
And exceeds it. I do not want you to worry.

144
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,886
You do not be so always know?

145
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,706
I am with...

146
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,408
strong and good person I've met in my life.

147
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,120
I love you madly.

148
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,653
- You sneezed on me. - I know.

149
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,764

151
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,998
Wait a moment.

152
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,758
- Yes, Victoria? - Should I talk to you now.

153
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,039
Well, we're done here.

154
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,154
Thanks guys.

155
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,496
Stop ignoring me.

156
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:09,561
I know that guys are after Wiseman above, what happens?

157
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,913
- Where did you hear that? - It is true?

158
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,461
Does not concern you. Yes?

159
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,581
- Wiseman was my boy. - If and more.

160
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,037
- Why are you crying? - You come after my only boy lost?

161
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,661
We finish this in my office.

162
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,433
I do not understand why you're so upset?

163
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:33,556
- You did not go that closed the program? - Yes, because it was a fluctuating pattern.

164
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,498
For lastimábamos people.

165
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,482
He would not expect me finish and then I kicked his ass.

166
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,251
- And he will take the bones of my operations. - I am now a supervisor.

167
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,878
- The main squad. - What you're temporarily by licking ass.

168
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,302
Because I'm the right man for the job.

169
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,432
Who says it? Does Daffy Duck?

170
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,138
Daffy Duck ...

171
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:54,484
Well, it seems that I do it well, because I have the job two years ago.

172
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,648
It is assumed that in two months you had to protect troops, not kill them.

173
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,990
- Victoria, clean the dirt. - Than?

174
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,591
Mike Howell tried to stay with the city.

175
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,160
It should be removed.

176
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,495
Are you going to kill him, trying to stay in town?

177
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,759
That is its safety limit. Just I am doing my job.

178
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,373
- I'm doing my job. - It is a human.

179
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:10,374
You're wrong.

180
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,179
- It's an American citizen. - It is government property.

181
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,056
You know what the fuck are you saying?

182
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:17,759
- What mouth. - Listen, idiot king.

183
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:19,578
- If you think I sentaré- - Listen to your ...

184
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,657
tremendous ordinary bank. Howell died today!

185
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,331
And if you can not do anything. What are you going to do?

186
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,259
Are you going to bite?

187
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,623
You're my fucking dog here, okay?

188
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,230
Sit down! Stay!

189
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:36,370
Turn arround. Now get out ...

190
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,499
my fucking office.

191
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:46,553
<B> Rose: See you in 15 minutes </ b>?

192
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,934
Mike, what's up?

193
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:58,491
Swim alone...

194
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,850
I go to work.

195
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,155
Is not it early?

196
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,641
Yes Yes.

197
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:08,184
But I must do something.

198
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:09,876
What?

199
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,856
Food.

200
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,371
I love you.

201
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,875
Rose.

202
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,875
What guy?

203
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,332
- How are you? - What guy?

204
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,233
- What's up! - I appreciate you doing this for me.

205
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,492
Come on man, you know I love you, right?

206
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,311
Do I appreciate my black, black, black, you know it?

207
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:57,313
Yes.

208
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:58,605
Well, well, go and open the trunk.

209
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,344
- All right. - All right, it's cute.

210
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,413
Very good, quiet, is not a big problem ...

211
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,867
Calm.

212
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,317
Are you ready?

213
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,712
Go Go.

214
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,655
All right.

215
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,317
This is more illegal than what I have normally.

216
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,596
You understand me?

217
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:21,635
These are expensive fireworks that light up the whole sky.

218
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,828
Rose, Phoebe will love this.

219
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:27,194
This is perfect Rose is perfect.

220
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,890
Thanks dude.

221
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:33,547
And tell me this is for a purpose of annihilation you do?

222
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:34,362
Did you know son?

223
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,576
- That's the plan. - Seems to want your slut.

224
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,674
- I love her. - You must do when you love.

225
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,583
- If you know a friend. - If exactly, it comes once in life.

226
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,309
- That I say. - Yes.

227
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,982
Yes Yes. - Fine thanks.

228
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:44,983
- You leave? - Yes.

229
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,943
- Where are you going? - I leave it and go to work.

230
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,002
Want something? ¿Foursome drug?

231
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,542
Not well. It is 8:13 is too early for that, Rose.

232
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,423
Thanks Nancy.

233
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:55,923
Thanks Bryan.

234
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:08,346
<B> Marry? </ B>

235
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,470
Progression attentive, listening ...

236
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,423
the man is on the move ...

237
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,694
has broken the gap, put the ball in play.

238
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,563
That's a guess, or something?

239
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,776
Fuck.

240
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,588
Do not.

241
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,332
Attentive progression, Listen.

242
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,366
According.

243
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,527
- The man is moving. - Ma'am, do you take something?

244
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:02,632
- Progression attentive Mike! - Lady can stop that please?

245
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,567
- Progression attentive. - Are you OK?

246
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,704
Listen.

247
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,798
The man is moving.

248
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,542
<I> He has broken the gap ... </ i>

249
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,613
<I> Progression attentive, careful progression. </ I>

250
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,605
<I> Progression attentive. </ I>

251
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,076
<I> is in motion. Movement. </ I>

252
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,451
- Mike. Please you are in danger ... - Lady is enough ...

253
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,959
- You should listen. - Stop. I must close soon.

254
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,634
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

255
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,669
For all this. Sorry Mike, I tried.

256
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,577
All right.

257
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,147
You do not want your soup?

258
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,637
Stop bothering my car.

259
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:25,971
- What about honey? - I just killed two people.

260
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:28,736
- Two, I killed. - Sounds great.

261
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,324
These two were trying to steal my car and had guns and knives ...

262
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:34,464
and they were being idiots and attacked me.

263
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:37,128
- Honey calm down. - Take a spoon and ...

264
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:40,394
- Stabs one. - Did you call the police?

265
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,521
I have not called the police because I am the murderer, okay?

266
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:46,685
And I have marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms in my car.

267
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,377
I just killed two guys in the parking lot!

268
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,972
If you do not come now, I'll start to pee in your pants ...

269
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,146
I swear to God I'll Phoebe pee.

270
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,758
How did this happen?

271
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,973
How the hell did this happen?

272
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,786
I shot him in the head.

273
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,230
And that, kind ...

274
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:08,814
you key spoon in the neck and fell.

275
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,756
- Did you just kill two guys? - They were trying to ...

276
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,798
- Stab Phoebe. - Why they try to do that?

277
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:16,834
I do not know!

278
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,683
I do not know but...

279
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,529
I'm really scared. By Phoebe what happened here.

280
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,535
I am very anxious about this.

281
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:25,623
<I> Hands up! </ I>

282
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,695
I'm screwed.

283
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,798
<I> What have you done Mike? </ I>

284
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:29,868
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:30,940
<I> Throw it! </ I>

286
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,367
<I> What do you two low? </ I>

287
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,035
We lost two trying to neutralize the cash Howell.

288
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:41,058
- How is that possible? - I had a spoon Lord.

289
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,885
A damn! ¿Spoon?

290
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,721
Than?

291
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,554
We're not sure why the confrontation but ...

292
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,958
You should activate.

293
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:49,261
- Did you see that? - Yes sir.

294
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,781
This is Lasseter. She's in town.

295
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,612
Find her.

296
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,534
Closed the bridge, no one enters, no one leaves.

297
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,519
- Yes sir. - Where is Howell, now?

298
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,855
- This arrested sir. - Perfect!

299
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,597
Well, we go in and take it out.

300
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,759
<I> you stuck in one place, you can not get out. </ I>

301
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:05,669
Yes sir!

302
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,560
<I> Use the Frame and Laugher effective. </ I>

303
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,171
Except that...

304
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:20,314
Tell me again to clarify this.

305
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,559
No, no ...

306
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,638
I hit with the spoon.

307
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,561
And they blew their lungs.

308
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:28,568
What happened to your lungs?

309
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:29,644
Nothing happened.

310
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,452
Because I could not breathe because I hit in the neck.

311
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:36,301
- How do you know of the lungs? - What is Phoebe.

312
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,234
No, that does not make sense to me, Phoebe.

313
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:43,826
- You said something about a lady? - Yes!

314
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:47,154
- What did he say? - Well, she said ...

315
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,657
talking pure nonsense, I do not know, like ...

316
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,859
Affection. We are in jail.

317
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,686
Try to remember and focus on what he told you.

318
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,628
- What the lady said? - All right.

319
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,755
Said.

320
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,855
Mental process in progress, put the ball in play.

321
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,992
- What the hell does that mean? - I do not know.

322
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,796
Phoebe, I do not know, but I remember it as if it had just passed.

323
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,352
I remember everything that happened to me in the last 94 minutes.

324
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:28,498
94 minutes is a number, Phoebe.

325
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:32,012
- I remember literally every second that- - Listen, just ...

326
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,758
Calm down.

327
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:35,759
If Mike.

328
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,761
You need to calm down.

329
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,952
I've been in this police station. Mike ...

330
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,076
since you were 22 years old.

331
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,590
Your freedom is like ...

332
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:03,613
Michael Jordan's nonsense. Because you never saw more than ...

333
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,690
a couple of hours?

334
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:09,679
But tonight?

335
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,730
Come and kill these people.

336
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,124
They attacked, had to defend himself.

337
00:26:17,624 --> 00:26:20,027
- Forgiveness? - What would I do?

338
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,244
Are you his girlfriend, his mother, housekeeper?

339
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,393
Does your landlady?

340
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,365
Now is your lawyer? Why what he happened?

341
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,101
I think this happened.

342
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:37,628
- Mike. - I did not want to.

343
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,159
You wanted?

344
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,298
Two men are dead Mike.

345
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,994
No way out this time.

346
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,470
What the hell is that?

347
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:48,471
<I> What? </ I>

348
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,624
<I> Lock him! </ I>

349
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:52,633
We have a problem.

350
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:59,198
- What is the problem? - I do not know Phoebe, just get moving.

351
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,644
Wait.

352
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,589
What happens there?

353
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,366
Just wait.

354
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,663
All outside lights are off.

355
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,561
Radio, internet, phone.

356
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,057
What the hell is that?

357
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,744
Mike!

358
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,298
Care.

359
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:45,655
<I> Move, move! </ I>

360
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:48,719
Come on!

361
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,128
Everybody down!

362
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,307
Phoebe Duck! Go!

363
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,325
Phoebe left the weapon.

364
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,705
Let's go!

365
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,577
Get out of here!

366
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,673
Come on.

367
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,596
Just a moment!

368
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,705
- Hello dear. - Why you have locked Liman?

369
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,411
Why have men in costume as if they aliens?

370
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,134
- What are you doing? - A mad dog is loose ...

371
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,580
- A real old whore. - Yes you have Adrian class.

372
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:35,241
The activaste, now two of my best men are dead.

373
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,558
I know why you're here, do not mess with my operation.

374
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,019
Your operation is murder.

375
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:40,989
It is the last time we talked.

376
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,319
I'm going down Yates, do you understand me?

377
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:45,531
That's not much for a middle-aged woman with ...

378
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:49,135
What is a mobile phone? You can not touch me. All right.

379
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,111
You can not just hang me?

380
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:54,212
Please tell me that not hung.

381
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,193
Phoebe, where are we going?

382
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,553
We go! We will leave the damn city!

383
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,520
I can not leave the city, you know.

384
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,554
They had never before tried to kill you ...

385
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,986
I never had that motivation. So...

386
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,432
Well, where are you going?

387
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,505
- Damn! - Look, I'll take my car ...

388
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:13,560
- And I will go to the house of Rosa. - Than?

389
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,990
- Than? - You want to get high now?

390
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,499
- Mike? - I do not want. Do not!

391
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,528
Rose has weapons and stuff. Yes?

392
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:23,037
And he can help us. And I'm still handcuffed.

393
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,367
You're in no position to make plans now.

394
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,265
Really? Who else? The cops are all dead.

395
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,271
The guy in the cell.

396
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:34,643
You pointed the gun and you said ... Weapon?

397
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,765
Well, I recognize that now, it is like out of mind, sorry.

398
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,105
Is someone trying to kill you, do not put yourself as:

399
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,497
What do you want to talk about?

400
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,105
Well, you're right. Sorry Sorry.

401
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:49,494
Just let me scream, okay?

402
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,636
- I'm not starting to scare. - You are.

403
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,229
We should try to solve and to do!

404
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,541
Are you okay. I'm fine.

405
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,851
Well, we're on our way. Yes?

406
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:01,979
And nothing happened. I promise.

407
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,663
Just go to my car.

408
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,007
Damn!

409
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:09,715
That made those guys. Demons.

410
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,176
All right.

411
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,884
Take my car.

412
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:44,477
<B> Unknown. </ B>

413
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,791
Hello.

414
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:50,015
I'm in Liman, I activated Howell.

415
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:50,762
Than?

416
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,425
<I> Yates and their agents are in town. </ I>

417
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:56,744
Howell tried to save and end this operation.

418
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:59,604
<I> But something is not right. I am facing the sheriff's station ... </ i>

419
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:01,502
- And is burned. - I do not get it.

420
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:05,121
- Because you ... you should not? - Listen me.

421
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,146
- I need weapons. - OMG.

422
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:10,019
<I> The operation is clean, I will send coordinates to thank me. </ I>

423
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:14,195
And I want to know where the hell Yates brings to the subject of this operation.

424
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:16,780
<I> The procedure must be quick and quiet. </ I>

425
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,610
<I> This is nonsense. </ I>

426
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,668
Well, sorry, I have to hang up.

427
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:22,344
- I can not, I can not. - No !, not.

428
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,824
<I> Do not hang up, do not hang up. </ I>

429
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,530
I'm locked in the city, and I caught like a rat ...

430
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,597
and he will kill me.

431
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,891
Please Petey need you.

432
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,958
Very good. Here we go.

433
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,556
You do not make any noise. You are very quiet.

434
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,094
Yes, I am silent.

435
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:01,916
I am like...

436
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,836
I think I'm in a "allergic shock".

437
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,778
Try to calm down.

438
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,282
I try to think of good things but ...

439
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,344
Phoebe can not remember anything, like you never ...

440
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,302
I not remember having gone to school.

441
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,469
- Honey, do not think about that. - I went to school?

442
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,885
We talk sometimes my parents?

443
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,385
Do we walk from here and see what happens along the way?

444
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,583
- Yeah. - Come on.

445
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,336
- Fuck. - Than?

446
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,096
What if I'm like ...

447
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:44,900
A robot?

448
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,217
With gigabytes of memory reloaded.

449
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:53,481
Scheduled to fight and kill people.

450
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,505
Honey, you're not a robot.

451
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,309
What biological engineering?

452
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,648
- Maybe I am. - Mike.

453
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,791
Yes.

454
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:04,358
- You're not a robot. - How do you know it?

455
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:08,766
- There are strange things in my head. - I know. I know honey.

456
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,536
You know the golden M-1?

457
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,762
It is a type of tank.

458
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,570
It's like a bus.

459
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,833
50 kinds of tanks, when I learned of tanks?

460
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,717
I did not do it.

461
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:24,094
I know nothing of tanks, guns or bombs.

462
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:27,146
But now suddenly all of tanks and weapons and-

463
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,181
Hold it!

464
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:30,655
- Mike almost shot you! - Rose.

465
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,561
- What are you doing here? - Can we move on?

466
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:34,865
No no no! Come on, métanse, métanse now, man!

467
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,153
How to come out at night? Is the disease from monkeys?

468
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:39,188
Let métanse.

469
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,791
<I> What the hell? </ I>

470
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,615
What the hell is all this?

471
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,773
Mr. Yates!

472
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:10,061
I said are discrete, covering all!

473
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:13,298
Do not put a fortress in the parking lot!

474
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,414
Lord, this is ...

475
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:15,528
Where are the troops?

476
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,454
Do you have a truck sitting in the dark?

477
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,972
- Lord isolate. - Well, you're right.

478
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,800
Thank you.

479
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:30,706
Laugher.

480
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:34,442
What happened to you? I thought you were not here.

481
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:37,556
We found the sheriff's station.

482
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,471
Did you see it not? What Howell?

483
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,268
He knocked the teeth.

484
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,757
But I recovered.

485
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,438
We just want to be a couple of hours because things are ...

486
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,438
I do not know, very dangerous now.

487
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,489
Yes, and why you come with us! Why did not you stay at home?

488
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:06,338
You say crazy, do crazy things, and here comes a madman.

489
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:09,128
I do not know what you do here. You know what I say?

490
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,782
Rose do not know, we just wanted to be safe.

491
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:16,159
Safe from what? Wait. Why do you think you're dangerous?

492
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:18,105
I did that before because:

493
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,483
- Those that? - Monkeys, monkeys!

494
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,121
And what you want to be safe?

495
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:26,726
Why do you say want to be safe?

496
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,360
Rose ... What Mike?

497
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,306
Together forever, man.

498
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:33,958
If the house is great, man!

499
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:36,349
My black, these are Mike and Phoebe.

500
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,646
- Wait ... - How are you?

501
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,793
Jinx ¿not? You were first as 3 weeks to injury.

502
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:47,728
Than? We did the best football team.

503
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:51,199
You did not even tell me? Fuck.

504
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:56,637
Now they have fantasies of football. You ignoring Rose, from what you say.

505
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:58,806
I guess that Rose should be alone. Guys.

506
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,344
You can come to football.

507
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:03,766
That does not make me feel any better, nobody asked you shit.

508
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,047
How rude.

509
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,367
Sorry, but it goes with conspiracies tonight.

510
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:12,309
Sorry. Can I ask what the monkeys?

511
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:15,652
- And gas mask? - Have not you heard?

512
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,719
The government has the city under fire.

513
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:23,268
There is a kind of disease that is dominating this shit.

514
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,836
- I'm sorry? - Than? Watch the TV!

515
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:31,925
Watch TV watching this shit.

516
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,063
Do you see what I say happens?

517
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:40,695
<I> The disease has been described as a supertifus, began this afternoon. </ I>

518
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,481
<I> The bridge of the city is closed to enter or leave the city. </ I>

519
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:46,074
What do you say? What did I say?

520
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,206
- Not ... - "Two individuals ..."

521
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:51,242
It can not be real.

522
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,625
<I> If you have knowledge of his whereabouts ... </ i>

523
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:55,413
<I> contact authorities immediately. </ I>

524
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,766
This is not right.

525
00:39:57,797 --> 00:40:01,010
<I> It is very contagious, stay away under any circumstances. </ I>

526
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:05,304
<I> Official Lasseter reported that Victoria is responsible for the operation. </ I>

527
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,695
What do you do in the damn television, Mike?

528
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:11,376
<I> By the inappropriate contact with several test monkeys. </ I>

529
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,824
- Are you involved in this? - That's the woman I'm talking about?

530
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,637
- Yes! - Than?

531
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:20,001
What do you know damn monkeys, man?

532
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,065
Calm down.

533
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,152
What has it easy?

534
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,353
I fucking answers now!

535
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:26,960
No no no!

536
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:28,445
Okay Rose, listen.

537
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,173
Things do not mean what you think.

538
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,307
This will sound silly ...

539
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,911
<I> Call 1-304-1-32-01-98. </ I>

540
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,635
Something very strange happened to me tonight, okay?

541
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,269
I do not know what happens, I have killed people. Yes?

542
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:43,516
There is a possibility that I'm a robot.

543
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:49,552
Damn! You damn virus.

544
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:50,666
No Rose, stop.

545
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,489
- You must be quarantined, Mike. - Rose do not do that.

546
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,275
Back, stay away. You must be quarantined motherfucker!

547
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,315
- Heavens! - Do not!

548
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,036
How did you slut!

549
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,514
Rose, sorry.

550
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:22,262
Rose Well, whatever you do do not call that number of TV?

551
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:23,461
Do you think the government call?

552
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,416
You think you do not want them here?

553
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,411
- Can we talk about this, okay? - No. Mike, no.

554
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:29,612
I will not listen!

555
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,679
All right.

556
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,585
- Hey Rose. - Yes.

557
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,603
You can probably break that lock.

558
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,943
- Do not. - All right.

559
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,570
What place.

560
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:56,117
¿Phoebe. You think you can have this virus?

561
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,452
Than...? Does this false history of the disease from monkeys?

562
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:01,706
How do you know to be false?

563
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,353
I met this woman.

564
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,498
I do not feel bad?

565
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,023
Do you feel sick?

566
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,199
Not me...

567
00:42:24,677 --> 00:42:26,463
I feel great.

568
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:47,467
<B> PSYCHOTIC PARTICULAR, MAY ARM </ b>

569
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,505
<B> POLICE HUNT ESPAPA CRAZY </ b>

570
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:51,864
<B> ILL MURDERS </ b>

571
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,585
<B> Mental Patient Disappears facilities. </ B>

572
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,565
Oh my God.

573
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:00,862
Hello.

574
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:02,210
<I> Hello Petey. </ I>

575
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:05,681
<I> Why I heard a drone supply come from? </ I>

576
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:10,327
You understand that going against the efforts of a CIA operation.

577
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:11,929
¿Acting against national security?

578
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,021
What do we call that Petey?

579
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:18,402
When acting against the interests of country, is treason?

580
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,893
<I> Acláramelo because I forgot. </ I>

581
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,206
<I> What is the penalty for treason? </ I>

582
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,699
Do you carry out and shoot you in the fucking head?

583
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,498
<I> I'm aware that you are faithful to Lasseter. </ I>

584
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,233
<I> Do not do more. You will never operate. Got it? </ I>

585
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,315
<I> Thank you for things, I will find it now ... </ i>

586
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:59,547
but first you have to make this public, call Krueger ...

587
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:02,005
<I> I can not believe this Yates using mental patients for this. </ I>

588
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,215
I must inform you that it is my duty not to disclose this operation.

589
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,280
<I> Duty? What? </ I>

590
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
<I> We need for this, is completely - </ i>

591
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:12,048
If you do this operation you make public betrayal on betrayal ...

592
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,179
- from United States. - No, Petey.

593
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,228
- Peter. - I'm sorry.

594
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:17,264
Petey!

595
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,038
I can not help more.

596
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,617
Damn!

597
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,630
Phoebe, what are you doing?

598
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,929
I am seeking an escape.

599
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:41,173
Phoebe, stop, do not think we do that, okay?

600
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:43,514
We must wait here, Rose is good guy.

601
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:46,005
He's just sensible.

602
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:49,315
Honey, I'm not thinking ill of you sold the drugs.

603
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:55,969
<I> Already they located Howell? </ I>

604
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:57,365
It's in his friend's house.

605
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:00,657
Well, come on then. Understood?

606
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:03,436
¿Put Newman, Laugher and Burger, all ready?

607
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,570
- Yes sir! - Actívenlo and ...

608
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,021
I'll call air support.

609
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,217
No further incidents.

610
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:16,764
No more mistakes.

611
00:45:16,902 --> 00:45:18,864
Clean and sweep!

612
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,750
- Dammit! - You know you're doing?

613
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,063
I'll go ahead and see if I get to the other room.

614
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,432
Just a moment.

615
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,777
This is not the right time.

616
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:50,614
<I> - That I can not move. - I do not think that </ i>.

617
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,824
What's up?

618
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,762
Oh, hell!

619
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:07,639
Phoebe! Move!

620
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:11,661
Fuck.

621
00:46:39,983 --> 00:46:42,889
Grab the gun and let's go.

622
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:44,135
Let's go!

623
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:58,773
Affection?

624
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,804
Affection? Come here, come.

625
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:05,442
We awake. Come on.

626
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,472
You should be awake. Yes?

627
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:12,117
That crap will make you feel very tired. You'll help a little.

628
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,096
- Just stay awake, okay? - I feel sleepy.

629
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,592
Do not sleep! Do not sleep!

630
00:47:17,603 --> 00:47:19,570
Honey, if you sleep you die. Sleep and die.

631
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,965
So it works. Close your senses one by one.

632
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:23,967
Keep your eyes open. Open your damn eyes.

633
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:26,012
Affection. Affection?

634
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:27,047
Affection?

635
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,532
Honey awake. Wake up wake up. Yes?

636
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:34,349
No !, what whores ... no!

637
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:36,103
What with Chip and brick!

638
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:39,554
Apollo with the ape, I love it, I love it ...

639
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:43,588
if you die. You lose ... I love you.

640
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:46,152
Honey, please.

641
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:49,891
<I> Mike, wake up. </ I>

642
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,543

648
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,385
<I> Just you and me. </ I>

649
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:28,237
<I> You are free. </ I>

650
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:30,414

00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:36,028
<I> I love you. </ I>

654
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:39,125
<I> Interview number 13985. </ I>

655
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,670
<I> Mike! </ I>

656
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:45,336
<I> I love you. </ I>

657
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,338
<I> All right. </ I>

658
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:48,554
<I> Up. Breathe. </ I>

659
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,820
<I> Up. Wake up. </ I>

660
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,664
Mike. Breathe!

661
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:00,663
It's okay.

662
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:05,932
It's okay.

663
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,369
How did you know what was the gas?

664
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:17,646
It's okay.

665
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,458
No, no, what?

666
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,632
- How did you know what was the gas? - I do not know what happens.

667
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,115
But listen.

668
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:29,512
Affection.

669
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,768
Mike.

670
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,206
I do not know what happens.

671
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,373
But I know that about me, okay?

672
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:39,088
- Just listen. - Well, tell me.

673
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:45,365
- This does not make sense now. - What's up? Tell me.

674
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,619
I...

675
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,045
I'm your supervisor.

676
00:49:54,146 --> 00:49:56,250
You were assigned me five years ago.

677
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,755
Does my supervisor?

678
00:49:58,563 --> 00:49:59,889
Please understand, I ...

679
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:01,579
I am of the CIA, yes?

680
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,994
- But. - What about you?

681
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,838
Listen to me, okay. - Phoebe.

682
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:10,570
- I try to tell you this for a long time. - Are not you my girlfriend?

683
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:13,806
Of course I'm your girlfriend! Affection.

684
00:50:14,913 --> 00:50:16,581
So I say, no ...

685
00:50:17,005 --> 00:50:19,815
To please, I can not even look at you .. I must go.

686
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,583
Mike!

687
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,083
Mike, let me explain.

688
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,525
- Mike. - Do not.

689
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,530
- Leave me alone. - Open the door, Mike!

690
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,856
Leave me alone!

691
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,824
Oh, hell.

692
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:43,666
No, let me, let me, let me go.

693
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,039
Well, I know something.

694
00:50:53,244 --> 00:50:54,809
I am real?

695
00:50:55,563 --> 00:50:57,052
Yeah, you're real.

696
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,557
Are your parents really dead?

697
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:07,293
Is everything you told me is a lie?

698
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,918
- Not everything is a lie. - Please do not use that voice with me.

699
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,539
- No. - I was in love with you.

700
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:18,186
I'm in love with you, and who is not you?

701
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:21,219
- Stop it, Mike! - Stop mourn falsely ...

702
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,347
to cover all this ...

703
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:26,708
and leave my emotions, just stop mourn.

704
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:28,018
Please stop it.

705
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:32,443
Hears! Stop! Yes? Damn! Stop!

706
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,869
I will not lie anymore.

707
00:51:40,155 --> 00:51:43,327
Give me one more chance to show you that you do not lie, right?

708
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:45,585
Clear.

709
00:51:46,744 --> 00:51:49,864
- No, Mike. - Phoebe, get out of my car.

710
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,327
- I can not. - Get out of my car! Yes?

711
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:55,702
- Get out of my car! - It's my damn car!

712
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,239
Just get out of the car!

713
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:52,836
Phoebe!

714
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:54,771
<I> Phoebe! </ I>

715
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,516
How to survive a lie?

716
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:14,291
You're lucky.

717
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,996
No, no ...

718
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,599
Phoebe! Phoebe!

719
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:34,574
! Phoebe!

720
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,780
I want to do something very bad.

721
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:48,032
Phoebe ...

722
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:59,793
Fuck.

723
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:07,804
Oh, hell! what is that?

724
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:09,492
Is gasoline?

725
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:10,614
Yes!

726
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,545
Do not! Hell, no.

727
00:54:14,353 --> 00:54:15,585
Oh, hell!

728
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:16,686
Come on, man.

729
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,125
I hate you man!

730
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:21,304
I also hate you man!

731
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:44,407
I wanted to tell you something.

732
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:45,873
Hey, wake up.

733
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:54,650
Hears. Wake up!

734
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,831
I said I wanted to say something.

735
00:54:58,496 --> 00:54:59,496
Look!

736
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:07,664
Mike. Mike!

737
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,621
Mr!

738
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:29,492
God, but it is the Cinderella 2010.

739
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,382
Yates. What are you doing here?

740
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:34,657
I am a professional.

741
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,711
Who is running this operation?

742
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:41,106
Since when desktop like you guys are in the field?

743
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:44,641
Because it's a problem, I was in the dark five years, can not I?

744
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,268
Do you have an authorization from this?

745
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,800
Where is Krueger?

746
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:52,708
Phoebe Silver, which left the program ...

747
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,023
and return here. Will you question my operation?

748
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:58,829
I read your file!

749
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,054
You have no secrets from me.

750
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:05,356
Your boyfriend is not real.

751
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:08,222
We created it.

752
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:14,150
Sorry if you finished working on "Taco Bell".

753
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:17,192
It's probably why you ruined your life.

754
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:19,434
I guess so.

755
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,427
Look what I am now in charge of a major operation.

756
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,103
And look where you are.

757
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,387
Under arrest for insubordination and waiting.

758
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:33,052
And I get a promotion.

759
00:56:33,086 --> 00:56:36,197
Your pathetic boyfriend will be neutralized.

760
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:47,561
It's okay.

761
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:50,666
Mike.

762
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:53,206
Do you recognize me?

763
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:54,914
You know my name?

764
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,487
Are you the wife of the market?

765
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,641
Yes.

766
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,519
But you know who I am?

767
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,552
Are you my mother?

768
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:09,657
Do not.

769
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,634
- No no no. - Do not!

770
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,521
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me about me.

771
00:57:30,273 --> 00:57:32,554
Look...

772
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:35,860
when you were eighteen, I saw you.

773
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:38,123
That was the first time I met you.

774
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,108
He is recruiting people for a program called Wiseman.

775
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:45,833
Basically the volunteers gave extra abilities.

776
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:49,318
And I offered the opportunity to volunteer.

777
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:50,780
¿Volunteer for what?

778
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:53,717
To be ... To be an experiment.

779
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,148
An experiment?

780
00:57:57,963 --> 00:57:59,021
Yes.

781
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,021
That was a mistake.

782
00:58:02,134 --> 00:58:03,969
No, Mike, you ran.

783
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:08,222
All others were failures but not you.

784
00:58:09,942 --> 00:58:11,300
You succeeded.

785
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:18,240
But I was going crazy.

786
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:20,677
Turned away all crazy.

787
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:25,003
The risks were horrible and very large.

788
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:29,215
So I closed it and gave them a new life ...

789
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,880
a new identity.

790
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:33,358
- To you you started here. - Yes.

791
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:36,617
So my memories erased ...

792
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:39,800
You fucked my head.

793
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,759
And you left me here.

794
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,806
With a fake girlfriend.

795
00:58:47,913 --> 00:58:49,411
No, Mike, please.

796
00:58:51,016 --> 00:58:52,882
This is not who you are.

797
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:55,918
You can not leave town.

798
00:58:56,088 --> 00:58:57,851
Phobias.

799
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:00,748
- We did that to protect you. - Protect me?

800
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,750
Yes.

801
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:04,128
And the guys trying to kill me?

802
00:59:04,427 --> 00:59:07,675
Hears! You're the woman on TV!

803
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:08,967
Hello.

804
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:10,840
Fucked monkeys.

805
00:59:11,871 --> 00:59:12,871
Than?

806
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,420
Mike, where are you going?

807
00:59:16,942 --> 00:59:17,873
Mr...

808
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:19,336
Howell still alive.

809
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:22,628
He was seen at a gas station. For the Chesnut Street.

810
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:25,090
Damn!

811
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:34,992
Hello.

812
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:36,126
<I> Hello Petey. </ I>

813
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,650
<I> I need a drone in the sky in less than an hour. </ I>

814
00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:40,445
Call me when you come into my airspace.

815
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:46,295
So you'll fly a village full of civilians?

816
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:48,289
- I have to do it. - To capture a single guy?

817
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,289
So is!

818
00:59:49,942 --> 00:59:50,942
Phoebe.

819
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:52,934
This is over.

820
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,123
It's okay.

821
01:00:06,224 --> 01:00:08,059
Come on! Back to work!

822
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:28,230
<I> Dron, 3.5 off in parallel on the road. </ I>

823
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:32,402
<I> He again watching ... </ i>

824
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,869
<I> Two subjects east along the perimeter. </ I>

825
01:00:36,255 --> 01:00:37,889
You will return to the house.

826
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:39,659
It will not return to the house.

827
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:42,005
Mike can be a bit slow at times ...

828
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,166
but it's not a fucking idiot.

829
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,668
Mike, I can not let you get back to your house.

830
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:47,315
I'm going in and I'm going to sleep.

831
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:50,012
They have snipers may be there now.

832
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,286
Then shoot me! Please!

833
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,682
Why are you still here?

834
01:00:53,873 --> 01:00:55,536
- I do not want you to die? - Why?

835
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:57,344
Why...

836
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,250
Because I care about you.

837
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:02,094
Very good. I do not care, okay?

838
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:03,260
And if I die.

839
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:07,505
I'll do it and laugh in my bed.

840
01:01:08,052 --> 01:01:10,626
You can stay or you can go.

841
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,510
Otis, I need you and Beedle the house to view the location of Lasseter.

842
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:19,126
And Howell.

843
01:01:19,128 --> 01:01:20,159
- But now.

844
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,164
- Thank you, now. - Yes sir!

845
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,701
What the hell view?

846
01:01:58,036 --> 01:01:59,385
Who is Apollo Ape?

847
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:05,527
It is a monkey astronaut.

848
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,074
I did, and live adventures.

849
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:18,195
Mike, Phoebe is not supposed to return.

850
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:26,541
When you were on the show, she always take care of you.

851
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,835
While the other subjects failed ...

852
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:31,000
you had success.

853
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,771
She has great faith in you.

854
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,411
You were assigned to it ..

855
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:40,862
We were supposed to leave town and out reassigned.

856
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:45,206
She decided to stay with you.

857
01:02:45,418 --> 01:02:48,264
She left everything, a whole new life.

858
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:51,130
I thought you should know that.

859
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:00,297
Lady. Lasseter

860
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,079
Sighting. We have them in sight.

861
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,106
Confirm sighting.

862
01:03:27,826 --> 01:03:29,108
Requesting immediate reinforcements.

863
01:03:29,108 --> 01:03:31,157
Copied. Do not let them go. ¿Colin?

864
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:34,159
- What with Howell? - Shoot the drone, come on.

865
01:03:34,193 --> 01:03:35,896
Let's hit.

866
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:39,483
Agent Douglas, please confirm.

867
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:43,150
- Ready to hit. - We'll give you the position.

868
01:03:46,077 --> 01:03:47,077
All right.

869
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:48,945
All right.

870
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:50,282
Oh, hell!

871
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:52,260
Very good. Stay here.

872
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:28,009
Beedle!

873
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,588
<I> Target in progress. Confirmation of destruction. </ I>

874
01:04:44,936 --> 01:04:45,936
Fire!

875
01:04:46,105 --> 01:04:48,072
<I> Agent Douglas confirmed. </ I>

876
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:49,898
<I> Fire! </ I>

877
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:52,467
What is wrong with you people? Throw him already!

878
01:05:03,021 --> 01:05:04,021
Throw him already!

879
01:05:13,965 --> 01:05:15,539
Now! Fire! Now!

880
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,230
<I> Lord lose the distance of the target. </ I>

881
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,213
<I> - Damn idiots! - Agent Douglas </ i>.

882
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,876
10, 9, 8, ...

883
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:53,170
7, 6, 5, 4 ...

884
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:54,784
Fuck!

885
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,934
<I> off target. </ I>

886
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:17,931
So that was the trick.

887
01:06:32,143 --> 01:06:33,143
Oh, hell.

888
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,824
<B> Call. </ B>

889
01:06:48,907 --> 01:06:49,907
Speaks Krueger.

890
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:51,143
<I> Hello Mr. Krueger. </ I>

891
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:53,398
<I> Do you have a moment? </ I>

892
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:12,648
<I> Withdraw immediately following the protocol. </ I>

893
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:29,922
How is it that you managed all this lead?

894
01:07:33,972 --> 01:07:35,282
Do not answer.

895
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,380
- Are you the kind that- - definitely it.

896
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,295
- Then I'll respond. - No, Mike.

897
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,364
- Hello? - Hello.

898
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
<I> Who is it? </ I>

899
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:52,554
You first.

900
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:54,318
Are you fuck?

901
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:56,059
Listen.

902
01:07:56,094 --> 01:07:57,862
- Are you Mike Howell? - Yes.

903
01:07:57,862 --> 01:08:00,018
- Who you are? - The house is not ...

904
01:08:01,605 --> 01:08:05,452
- Burning? - No, the house is as usual.

905
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,005
Very good.

906
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:10,596
<I> What's the plan now? </ I>

907
01:08:10,976 --> 01:08:13,440
I mean, do you surrender?

908
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:15,632
Well, you caught me.

909
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:17,402
I give up.

910
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:23,686
Why do not you come to me and accept my surrender?

911
01:08:23,688 --> 01:08:25,096
About how Wilson?

912
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:25,988
Yes.

913
01:08:26,057 --> 01:08:29,328
It's what is across the tire store is 10 minutes.

914
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:31,716
Than? If it is okay.

915
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,279
What happens when I see you there ...?

916
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,018
And do you accept the surrender, I sign something?

917
01:08:42,106 --> 01:08:43,662
Your girlfriend is here.

918
01:08:44,676 --> 01:08:46,519
Would you like to tell you, I love you?

919
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:48,936
I do not know.

920
01:08:51,382 --> 01:08:54,997
What if I grab my gun and blow your head?

921
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:56,645
Would it be great with that?

922
01:09:00,692 --> 01:09:02,203
No, it would not be great.

923
01:09:03,028 --> 01:09:04,170
Did she really is with you?

924
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:20,545
Mike.

925
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:26,845
I'm sorry.

926
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,542
I have been honest.

927
01:09:32,957 --> 01:09:34,818
I have always been sincere, even in the car.

928
01:09:36,457 --> 01:09:37,457
<I> Really? </ I>

929
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:40,493
I love you.

930
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:46,530
You can go, anywhere you want and never-

931
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:55,425
That was unfortunate.

932
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:03,435
Mike what do you do?

933
01:10:03,435 --> 01:10:05,243
I'll save my girlfriend.

934
01:10:06,024 --> 01:10:07,024
I'll handle this.

935
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:12,515
Now!

936
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:14,074
Get out of the fucking truck!

937
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:16,993
They know what to do.

938
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:18,738
Go Go. Fast!

939
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:19,869
Come on!

940
01:10:20,372 --> 01:10:21,372
That's!

941
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,903
This is the time so I have trained.

942
01:10:24,904 --> 01:10:27,353
This is not a trial. Yes?

943
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:31,637
This type is lethal, violent, and we should eliminate it.

944
01:10:31,649 --> 01:10:32,649
This clear?

945
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:58,319
Rufus, bring it here!

946
01:11:54,889 --> 01:11:55,889
¿Phoebe?

947
01:11:56,203 --> 01:11:57,207
¿Phoebe?

948
01:12:01,105 --> 01:12:02,304
- Phoebe. - Mike!

949
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,755
I never meant that. That I love you and ...

950
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:09,599
Everything will be OK.

951
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,768
Obviously not perfect, but ...

952
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:14,139
Best.

953
01:12:14,173 --> 01:12:15,694
<I> You probably want to know. </ I>

954
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:18,310
Pcs. Two might kill him, please.

955
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:19,856
Kill him.

956
01:12:20,024 --> 01:12:24,201
And this will end soon.

957
01:13:03,902 --> 01:13:04,902
¿Phoebe?

958
01:13:31,396 --> 01:13:32,599
Yates. Give up.

959
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,652
Let me go, that is all you want.

960
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,802
<B> food utensils. </ B>

961
01:13:51,983 --> 01:13:53,541
Go, go!

962
01:13:58,088 --> 01:13:59,988
Move.

963
01:14:02,828 --> 01:14:03,828
¿Phoebe?

964
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,164
Rufus, ends this.

965
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:25,975
Go ahead, Mike.

966
01:15:27,078 --> 01:15:28,429
Salt.

967
01:15:28,579 --> 01:15:30,060
I just want to talk with you.

968
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,238
Salt.

969
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:46,172
- Now you know. - Than?

970
01:15:46,372 --> 01:15:49,086
What is? What is what?

971
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:50,792
What do you say I know?

972
01:15:50,902 --> 01:15:51,902
Fuck!

973
01:15:52,002 --> 01:15:53,435
I am? Now?

974
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:57,217
You're pathetic, you know my boyfriend.

975
01:15:57,942 --> 01:15:59,341
You'll kill you know.

976
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,618
You know what?

977
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:12,226
I think you want one of my tooth.

978
01:16:46,658 --> 01:16:47,925
Fuck that.

979
01:16:51,729 --> 01:16:52,729
Fuck!

980
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:55,922
Introduce early morning at the agency ...

981
01:16:55,957 --> 01:16:58,890
I betrayed us, going behind your head.

982
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,748
You are scaring me.

983
01:17:05,009 --> 01:17:06,627
Please, can you go?

984
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:08,567
I just want to talk.

985
01:17:09,012 --> 01:17:10,029
I want to talk.

986
01:17:32,002 --> 01:17:33,027
I'm sorry.

987
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:36,065
But I can not remember.

988
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:41,868
The things they did to my head.

989
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:47,399
Did they do to you and to me.

990
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:52,742
But you're better than me.

991
01:17:54,993 --> 01:17:57,743
Who told you to do?

992
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:01,310
Anyone.

993
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:08,579
It must feel good.

994
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:48,844
Who is the bank now? Damn!

995
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:51,323
Enough, Laciret.

996
01:18:55,987 --> 01:18:56,987
Enough!

997
01:19:05,095 --> 01:19:06,304
Mike?

998
01:19:34,993 --> 01:19:36,082
Home...

999
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:46,570
You want to go home?

1000
01:19:48,372 --> 01:19:49,372
Yes.

1001
01:19:51,509 --> 01:19:52,766
It's okay.

1002
01:21:26,069 --> 01:21:27,702
He said yes!

1003
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,063
He said yes!

1004
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:45,855
Come on, I could give you a fellowships

1005
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,239
<I> Congratulations on the cursed forest in the bloody rain ... </ i>

1006
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,934
<I> this is an unacceptable level. </ I>

1007
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:22,456
I just wanted to say that Mr. Petey is not responsible for any ...

1008
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,752
action in the last 24 hours.

1009
01:22:23,753 --> 01:22:27,069
Douglas did not know what I did with you, helping you.

1010
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:30,122
Interfered directly in government operations.

1011
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:32,935
As a result you caused the deaths of dozens of civilians.

1012
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:33,970
That's right?

1013
01:22:35,006 --> 01:22:36,899
- Yes sir. - Absolutely right, sir.

1014
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:41,614
Thanks to Lasseter 7 Americans are dead.

1015
01:22:42,078 --> 01:22:45,047
- In our operation .. - Is the operation you created though ...?

1016
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:46,945
Does not have authorization?

1017
01:22:47,051 --> 01:22:49,212
- Is it right? - Yes sir!

1018
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,497
But you have to understand ...

1019
01:22:53,591 --> 01:22:54,907
I acted by choice.

1020
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:56,412
Excuse me?

1021
01:22:56,412 --> 01:22:57,699
I made mistakes ...

1022
01:22:58,095 --> 01:22:59,600
Do you know? Yes, I did.

1023
01:22:59,796 --> 01:23:01,720
Do I take shortcuts? Of course!

1024
01:23:01,765 --> 01:23:05,479
But in the end I justify what I did to fix ...

1025
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:08,421
replace it with another system. And they pushed me to do so.

1026
01:23:08,905 --> 01:23:11,033
You'd be grateful, right?

1027
01:23:14,078 --> 01:23:16,784
Come on, would you be thanking you?

1028
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:18,681
Yes.

1029
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:19,877
All right.

1030
01:23:22,487 --> 01:23:23,556
Thank you.

1031
01:23:35,099 --> 01:23:36,887
I do not think this is necessary.

1032
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:39,154
Please do not kill me.

1033
01:23:40,136 --> 01:23:41,619
I am your source.

1034
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:46,760
When I call you to tell you what happened.

1035
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:50,069
I did it out of courtesy and now regrets.

1036
01:23:51,349 --> 01:23:54,396
That was not my intention, but acted like a girl ...

1037
01:23:54,398 --> 01:23:56,350
and tried to save your puppy.

1038
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,483
The puppy was now. And now the puppy her dead puppy ...

1039
01:23:59,518 --> 01:24:01,632
And the puppy what is shitting everywhere!

1040
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:06,510
You have a crazy rabid puppy that kills people.

1041
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,953
And still you need to be settled.

1042
01:24:09,065 --> 01:24:11,782
You understood! Right?

1043
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:12,904
Yes sir!

1044
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:15,962
Maybe you are looking for the way this ends well ...

1045
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:18,109
and pulls out a miracle of your ass.

1046
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,270
Because if you can not.

1047
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:25,038
That will be you.

1048
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:30,077
And it has its miracle Lord.

1049
01:24:31,355 --> 01:24:33,409
My program works.

1050
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:36,421
Wiseman beat tough guys.

1051
01:24:36,514 --> 01:24:41,690
Mike Howell, remove 17 tough guys, one by one.

1052
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,934
That makes it the most efficient cash we have seen in any other program.

1053
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,002
Never.

1054
01:24:48,038 --> 01:24:49,038
In 60 years.

1055
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,274
Excuse me for saying so, sir.

1056
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:54,969
But saving the puppy saved ...

1057
01:24:56,046 --> 01:24:58,832
$ 400 million in puppies ...

1058
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:02,628
and he is sitting in a cell at this time.

1059
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:06,427
Are you going to kill?

1060
01:25:33,117 --> 01:25:34,913
Where do you want to start?

1061
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:36,881
Howell agent.

1062
01:25:42,828 --> 01:25:46,519
<B> Manila, Philippines, six months later. </ B>

1063
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:20,859
Be right back.

1064
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:21,860
According.

1065
01:26:50,528 --> 01:26:53,167
Hello.

1066
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:58,293
They took the bait.

1067
01:27:04,609 --> 01:27:05,898
Is the?

1068
01:27:08,078 --> 01:27:09,462
When we got him.

1069
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:12,318
Above all I had was this.

1070
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:16,440
<B> Fuck you! </ B>

1071
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:24,890
You think you're ready?

1072
01:27:26,365 --> 01:27:29,192
I'm Da Wei Rao.

1073
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,034
And they just sent a man?

1074
01:27:32,802 --> 01:27:34,770
An unarmed man?

1075
01:27:47,185 --> 01:27:48,976
Something you find funny?

1076
01:27:50,054 --> 01:27:51,054
I'm sorry.

1077
01:27:51,122 --> 01:27:53,829
I knew I could not speak Mandarin.

1078
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:07,122
Antillean and Th0ravenger work.
